## Overview

Given a point set P and a parameter t, an oriented t-spanner G is an oriented subgraph of the complete bi-directed graph, such that for every pair of points, the shortest cycle in G containing those points is at most a factor t longer than their shortest oriented path in the complete bi-directed graph. 

This open source project collects a set of algorithms to comput oriented spanners for 1D point sets.
